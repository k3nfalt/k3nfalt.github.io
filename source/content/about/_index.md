Hi! I am a postdoctoral fellow at KAUST, Visual Computing Center, where I work on modern optimization tasks with [Professor Peter Richt√°rik][1]. Previously, I defended my Ph.D. thesis at Higher School of Economics with my former supervisor, [Professor Alexander Gasnikov][2].

I also worked at Yandex Self-Driving Cars, Perception team, where I developed real-time computer vision algorithms for self-driving cars.
